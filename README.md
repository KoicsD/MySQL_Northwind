# MySQL_Northwind
Hello, this is a real [*MySQL*](https://dev.mysql.com/) task at [*CodeCool*](https://www.codecool.com/), based on [*Northwind Database*](https://theaccessbuddy.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/northwind-database-explained/)!

It's the 8th practical week at [*CodeCool*](https://www.codecool.com/). This week we have to write a program in [*python*](https://www.python.org/) that connects to a [*MySQL*](https://dev.mysql.com/) server and works on [*Northwind Database*](https://theaccessbuddy.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/northwind-database-explained/).
On the second half of the week we have to write some querries for our database, and we will check our work by a [*Java*](https://www.java.com/en/) application.

[You can find Task description here.](description.md)

The files mentors shared with us are in directory [*description*](description/).  
In directory [*sample_files*](sample_files/) you can find files I've created both for my own convenience and to let them contain some sample code.

Thank you for tracking our work!

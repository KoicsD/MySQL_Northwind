# MySQL_Northwind
Hello, this is a real [*MySQL*](https://dev.mysql.com/) task at [*CodeCool*](https://www.codecool.com/),
based on [*Northwind Database*](https://theaccessbuddy.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/northwind-database-explained/)!

On the 8th practical week at [*CodeCool*](https://www.codecool.com/)
we have to write a program in [*python*](https://www.python.org/)
that connects to a [*MySQL*](https://dev.mysql.com/) server
and works on [*Northwind Database*](https://theaccessbuddy.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/northwind-database-explained/).
On the second half of the week we have to write some querries for our database,
and we will check our work by a [*Java*](https://www.java.com/en/) application.

[You can find Task description here.](Description.md)

Project structure:

* The files mentors shared with us are in directory [*Description*](Description/).  
* In directory [*PythonSource*](PythonSource/) and [*SQLExcercises*](SQLExcercises/)
  you can find the *python*-files and *SQL*-scripts I've created as solution of the task, respectively.
* Before running, you have to create a directory named *Resources*
  and copy a valid *config.json* file to it (see [*SampleFiles*](SampleFiles/)).
  This directory is also intended to be the location of csv-data and is added to git-ignore list.
* In directory [*SampleFiles*](SampleFiles/) you can find files
  I've created both for my own convenience and to let them contain some sample code.
  [Here](SampleFiles.md) is a description about it's content.
* If you wish to practice with csv-files and you don't want to bother python in directory *Resources*,
  just create a directory named *Playground*.
  This name is also added to git-ignore list to prevent it from accidentally geting added to version-control.

If you want to try my program, [here are the steps to follow](HowToRun.md).
Or just simply use [startup.bat](startup.bat) on Windows.

Thank you for tracking our work!

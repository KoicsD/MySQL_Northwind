# MySQL_Northwind
Hello, this is a real MySQL task at CodeCool, based on Northwind Database!

It's the 8th practical week at CodeCool. This week we have to write a program in python that connects to a MySQL server and works on Northwind Database.
On the second half of the week we have to write some querries for our database, and we will check our work by a Java application.

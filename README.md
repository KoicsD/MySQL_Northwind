# MySQL_Northwind
Hello, this is a real [*MySQL*](https://dev.mysql.com/) task at [*CodeCool*](https://www.codecool.com/),
based on [*Northwind Database*](https://theaccessbuddy.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/northwind-database-explained/)!

It's the 8th practical week at [*CodeCool*](https://www.codecool.com/).
This week we have to write a program in [*python*](https://www.python.org/)
that connects to a [*MySQL*](https://dev.mysql.com/) server
and works on [*Northwind Database*](https://theaccessbuddy.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/northwind-database-explained/).
On the second half of the week we have to write some querries for our database,
and we will check our work by a [*Java*](https://www.java.com/en/) application.

[You can find Task description here.](Description.md)

The files mentors shared with us are in directory [*Description*](Description/).  
In directory [*PythonSource*](PythonSoucre/) and [*SQLExcercises*](SQLExcercises/)
you can find the python-files and SQL-scripts I've created as solution of the task, respectively.  
In directory [*SampleFiles*](SampleFiles/) you can find files
I've created both for my own convenience and to let them contain some sample code.

If you want to try my program, [here are the steps to follow](HowToRun.md).
Or just simply use [startup.bat](startup.bat) on Windows.

Thank you for tracking our work!

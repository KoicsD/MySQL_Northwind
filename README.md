# MySQL_Northwind
Hello, this is a real MySQL task at [*CodeCool*](https://www.codecool.com/), based on [*Northwind Database*](https://theaccessbuddy.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/northwind-database-explained/)!

It's the 8th practical week at CodeCool. This week we have to write a program in [python](https://www.python.org/) that connects to a [*MySQL*](https://dev.mysql.com/) server and works on [*Northwind Database*](https://theaccessbuddy.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/northwind-database-explained/).
On the second half of the week we have to write some querries for our database, and we will check our work by a [*Java*](https://www.java.com/en/) application.

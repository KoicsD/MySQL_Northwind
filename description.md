Connect to your localhost db as an admin  
Execute [01_Northwind.MySQL5_create_database.sql](sample/01_Northwind.MySQL5_create_database.sql)  
Execute [02_Northwind.MySQL5.sql](sample/02_Northwind.MySQL5.sql)  
Execute [03_Northwind_users_creation_and_grant_access.sql](sample/03_Northwind_users_creation_and_grant_access.sql)  
After this please tries to explore a DB structure and the data it contains. What kind of relationship are between the different tables. On this DB you can practice and repeat the basic SQL queries what you learnt. In the afternoon it will help us to summerize what you learnt about the SQL so far.
